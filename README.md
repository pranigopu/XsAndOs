# X's and O's (tic-tac-toe)

This is my implementation of the well-known game, tic-tac-toe. I have implemented both singleplayer and multiplayer variants.

In a 3x3 grid, the options are limited, but to list them exhaustively is exhausting and not the best method in general. To get a more efficient method for the computer to recognise and act on the player's moves was naturally the hardest bit of this project.
